Training Python
===============

I use this repository to Data structures, algorithms and my solutions
to programming puzzles.

Data structures
---------------

### Strings and arrays

- [ ] Remove duplicate chars
- [ ] Check two strings for being anagrams
- [ ] String replace
- [ ] Reverse words
- [ ] Rotate NxN matrix in place
- [ ] Set column and row to zero if cell in matrix is zero
- [ ] Check if string is rotation of another

### Linked lists

- [ ] List class
- [ ] Remove duplicates
- [ ] Remove duplicates in place
- [ ] Find nth last element
- [ ] Remove node given only its pointer
- [ ] Sum linked lists with one digit per node

### Stacks and queues

- [ ] Stack class
- [ ] Queue class
- [ ] Three stacks using a single array
- [ ] Stack that finds min in O(1)
- [ ] Large stack using sub stacks, allowing pop on main and sub stacks
- [ ] Solve Hanoi towers using stacks
- [ ] Queue by using two stacks
- [ ] Sort stack using only push, pop, peek and empty

### Trees and graphs

- [ ] Heap class
- [x] Binary search tree class
- [ ] Red black tree class
- [ ] B+ tree class
- [ ] Trie class
- [x] Undirected graph class
- [ ] Directed graph class
- [ ] Traverse a tree in depth first order
- [ ] Traverse a tree in breadth first order using a queue
- [ ] Check if tree is balanced
- [ ] Check if two nodes are connected in directed graph
- [ ] Create balanced binary tree from sorted array
- [ ] Get list of all nodes of depth n in a binary search tree
- [ ] Find successor in a binary search tree with parent pointers
- [ ] Find first common ancestor of two nodes in an unordered binary tree
- [ ] Given two large trees, check if the first is a subtree of the second
- [ ] Find all sub paths in a binary tree that sum up to x

### Hashmaps and sets

- [x] Hashmap class
- [ ] Hashset class

Algorithms
----------

### Bit manipulation

- [ ] Create bit range
- [ ] Copy bit range
- [ ] String to float, printing error when loosing data
- [ ] Print next smaller and larger numbers with same amount of set bits
- [ ] Count different bits of two numbers
- [ ] Swap every second bit with its predecessor
- [ ] Find missing number from array of consecutive integers with just
      comparing single bits

### Recursion

- [ ] Fibonacci number
- [ ] Count paths on grid with obstacles from top left to bottom right
- [ ] Find all permutations of a string
- [ ] Find all sub sets of a set
- [ ] Find all proper combinations of n parentheses
- [ ] Bucket fill
- [ ] Count representations of a price with coins of 25, 10, 5 and 1
- [ ] Find all chess boards with 8 queens so that they don't intersect

### Sorting and searching

- [ ] Bucket sort
- [ ] Quick sort
- [ ] Merge sort
- [ ] Merge sorted arrays where the first has empty buffer at the end to hold
      the second
- [ ] Order array so that anagrams are next to each other
- [ ] Find in array that is sorted but has many empty elements in between
- [ ] Find in matrix where each column and row is sorted
- [ ] Given pairs of height and weight, compute larges tower where above is
      always both shorter and lighter

### Mathematical

- [x] Of a telephone number find all letter representations from the dial pad
- [ ] Given n vertex polygon, compute probability of collision of n randomly
      headed walkers starting at the edges
- [ ] Subtraction, multiplication and division using plus operator
      and control flow statements
- [ ] Find nth smallest number with only prime factors 3, 5 and 7

### Memory limits

- [ ] Read and write file
- [ ] External merge sort
- [ ] A bloom filter
- [ ] Find integer that is not contained in a text file of 4 billion numbers

Concepts
--------

- [ ] Design a musical juke box
- [ ] Design a chess game
- [ ] Design data structures for online book reader system
- [ ] A jigsaw puzzle and solve it

### System design

- [ ] Thread pool
- [ ] Data structure for large friend network
- [ ] Design web crawler and avoid infinite loops
- [ ] Write chat server and client
